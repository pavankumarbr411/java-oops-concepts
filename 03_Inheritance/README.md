 What is Inheritance?
Inheritance means a child class getting features from a parent class.

 Just like you get some qualities from your parents (like eyes, height), in Java, one class can get variables and methods from another class.

This helps us re-use code, no need to write the same things again and again.

 Real-Life Example
Example: Vehicle â†’ Car
A Vehicle can honk

A Car is also a Vehicle, so it can honk too

But a Car also has extra features like model name
