# Day 03 - Inheritance in Java

## ðŸš— What is Inheritance?

**Inheritance** is one of the main concepts in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).  
It allows one class (child/subclass) to **inherit the properties and methods** of another class (parent/superclass).  

### ðŸ”‘ Key Points:
- It helps with **code reusability**.
- Promotes **hierarchical classification** (e.g., Animal â†’ Dog, Cat).
- Reduces **redundant code**.

## ðŸ’¡ Real-world Example: Car ðŸš˜

Letâ€™s say we have a **parent class `Car`** that defines basic car features, and a **child class `ElectricCar`** that inherits from `Car` and adds more specific features.

## Real-Life Example
Example: Vehicle â†’ Car
-- 
A Vehicle can honk
-- A Car is also a Vehicle, so it can honk too
-- But a Car also has extra features like model name
