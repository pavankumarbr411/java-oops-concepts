# Abstraction in OOPs – Java Example

##  What is Abstraction?
Abstraction is a fundamental concept in programming, especially in object-oriented programming (OOP), that involves simplifying complex systems by hiding unnecessary details and exposing only the essential information to the user. It's about focusing on "what" an object does rather than "how" it does it. 

Example:  
When we use a **TV remote**, we can press buttons to change channels without knowing how the signal works inside.

## 🎯 Key Points
- **Purpose** → Reduce complexity and increase security.
- **Achieved in Java** → Using:
  1. **Abstract classes** (`abstract` keyword)
  2. **Interfaces** (`interface` keyword)
- **Abstract methods** have no body and must be implemented by subclasses.
- You **cannot** create objects of abstract classes or interfaces.

##📊 Why is Abstraction Important?
Hides complexity → Keeps code clean.

Enhances security → Internal details are hidden.

Improves reusability → Common code stays in abstract classes.

Supports scalability → Easily add new implementations.

## 🏎 Real-Life Analogy
Driving a **Car**:
- we start, accelerate, stop.
- we don’t know how the engine works internally.
- **Abstraction** hides the engine complexity from us.
