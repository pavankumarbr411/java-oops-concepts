# Day 01 - Class and Object

This example explains the basic concept of Class and Object in Java in a simple way.

## ðŸ”¹ What is a Class?

A class is like a template or blueprint. It tells Java how to create an object â€” like what variables (data) and methods (actions) that object should have.

- Two variables: `name` and `age`

```java
Student s1 = new Student();
