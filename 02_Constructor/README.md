## DAY -02 Constructor  
##  Constructor â€“ Definition
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
It is called automatically when an object is created, and its purpose is to set initial values for object attributes.

## Real-World Example:
Imagine a Bank Account.
When someone opens a new bank account, we must store their name, account number, and initial balance.

So, we can use a constructor to automatically assign these values when a new account object is created.
